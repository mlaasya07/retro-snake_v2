## About This Game ♡
```
- This is my personal creation, built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks, 
  no unnecessary fluff. 
- It’s a celebration of simplicity, classic gameplay, and a touch of chaos.
- Eat apples → +1 Score
- Eat ice cream → +2 Score
- Avoid bombs → Game Over
- Control with Arrow Keys or WASD
- Pause/resume with SPACE
- It’s designed for fun and inspiration—feel free to explore it online, get ideas, 
  and see what’s possible with vanilla web tech.
